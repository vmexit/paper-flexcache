This section describes the design of \sys, which is \dots we wiil discuss the overview of \sys in \autoref{ss:overview}, 

\subsection{Overview}
\label{ss:overview}
\sys separates the cache into five parts to handle different types of objects.
%
We mark the object types as frequently accessed in all phases, continuously accessed in some phases, sparsely accessed in some phases, and 

\subsection{Fliter and hold for frequently accessed (FA-MP) objects}

\subsection{Ghost for misjudged (FA-FP) objects and prefetch}

\subsection{Dueling for suspected (IA-MP) objects}

\subsection{Duplicate metadata for prefetch temporal locality}

\subsection{Integrate \sys with phase aware}
