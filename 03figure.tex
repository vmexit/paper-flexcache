\XXX{explain the figure~\ref{fig:perf}.} We evaluate 9 state-of-the-art cache eviction algorithms from 
8 real-world benchmarks with \XXX{traces}.
%
These benchmarks come from diverse applications, including content delivery networks, key-value stores, and cloud block storage~(more details in \autoref{sec:eval}).
%
We do not consider the metadata size of different algorithms and assume all objects have the same size for an ideal case, 
which concentrates the ability to capture access patterns.
%
We evaluate these algorithms in libcachesim~\cite{} with a trace specific cache sizes, 3\% of the working set size.
%
To exhibit the performance clearly, numbers in \autoref{fig:perf} present the average performance improvement(\%) of each algorithm over LRU.
