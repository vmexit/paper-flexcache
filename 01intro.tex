However, the specific cache replacement policy will not be suitable for other access patterns or another cache size, leading to a sub-optimal situation.
%
S3-FIFO~\cite{} is the best policy when the cache size is tiny (0.3\%) to the working set size(WSS), but when the cache size is 20\% of the WSS in Cloudphysics~\cite{}, it achieves 90\% hit ratio to the optimal policy.

We divide the trace into phases based on cache size and flexibly adjust the criteria for determining object types according to their popularity in different phases. 
%
The replacement policy decides whether to retain an object based on its type.

After integrating prefetching, it identifies prefetchable objects and attempts to evict and prefetch them in the next time.
%
This dynamic replacement policy, which adapts to the relationship between cache size and trace, ensures suitability across various cache sizes.
