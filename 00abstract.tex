\begin{abstract}

Our key observation is that existing cache eviction algorithms are designed to be efficient for a subset of workload access patterns, thereby incurring suboptimal performance in many other cases.

Despite the impressive progress for the past decades, existing cache eviction algorithms are still limited in their ability to adapt to diverse workload access patterns, preventing them from delivering consistently high performance. 


Adaptive eviction algorithms promise to efficiently handle modern 
workloads by adjusting their behavior based on observed access patterns.
%
However, existing adaptive eviction algorithms fall short of this 
promise, to a degree that they are reported to even underperform their static 
counterparts~\cite{}. 
%
Indeed, as mentioned in prior work~\cite{}, converting a static cache eviction 
into an adaptive one even leads to performance degradation.
