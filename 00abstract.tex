\begin{abstract}

Our key observation is that existing cache eviction algorithms are designed to be efficient for a subset of workload access patterns, thereby incurring suboptimal performance in many other cases.

Despite the impressive progress for the past decades, existing cache eviction algorithms are still limited in their ability to adapt to diverse and evolving workload access patterns.
